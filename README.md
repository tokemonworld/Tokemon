Hello there! Welcome to the world of Tokémon! My name is Toak! People call me the Tokémon Prof! The crypto markets are inhabited by coins and tokens! For some people, they are used as banks. Other use them for speculative investments. Myself… I study Tokémon, Meme, and much more. Your very own Tokémon legend is about to unfold! A world of dreams and adventures awaits! Let's go!

## What is Tokémon (TM)?

Tokémon (TM) is an Ethereum ERC-20 Standard Compliant Token. It is the first ever Meme token, the first ever Parody Token and the first ever Meme and Parody Token. There are probably other things it is the first at too. There have been Meme coins done in the past, but never a Meme token based on the Ethereum blockchain. Tokémon's distribution system is also a key feature that generates value through it's own variation of mining, while creating scarcity to control the supply and demand. There is no relationship between the Pokémon franchise and Tokémon. We abide by all parody and copyright laws.

## What features / advantages does Tokémon have?

-  Being an ERC-20 Standard Compliant Ethereum Token, Tokémon benefits from pre-built secure Ethereum wallet software / apps that are already in common use. No need to reinvent the wheel. From wallets (Mist, MyEtherWallet, ethereum paper wallets) to decentralized Ethereum exchanges, etc.
- Being a meme / parody token, the core activities of Tokémon users revolves around memeing online, which in turn increases it's value through the spreading of interest in the token. 
- Tokémon uses a unique MINING and DISTRIBUTION system and works hand in hand with it's core meme / parody token concept. The only way to get Tokémon is through providing exposure (which is the version of mining Tokémon  implements), and the users who do it the most get the most tokens in return. Essentially a merit based system.
- The supply and demand is controlled in a way that assures scarcity, so as to increase the demand and overall value of Tokémon.
