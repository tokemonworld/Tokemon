# Tokemon

## What is Tokémon (TMN)?

Tokémon (TM) is an Ethereum ERC-20 Standard Compliant Token. It is the first ever Meme token, the first ever Parody Token and the first ever Meme and Parody Token. There are probably other things it is the first at too. There have been Meme coins done in the past, but never a Meme token based on the Ethereum blockchain. Tokémon's distribution system is also a key feature that generates value through it's own variation of mining, while creating scarcity to control the supply and demand. There is no relationship between the Pokémon franchise and Tokémon. We abide by all parody and copyright laws.

## What features / advantages does Tokémon have?(edited)

Being an ERC-20 Standard Compliant Ethereum Token, Tokémon benefits from pre-built secure software for wallets that are already in common use. No need to reinvent the wheel. Some examples are:

1.  Wallets (Mist, MyEtherWallet, ethereum paper wallets)
1.  Decentralized Ethereum exchanges from day one
1.  Simple minimalist code (available as open source on github)
