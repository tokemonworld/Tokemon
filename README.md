Hello there! Welcome to the world of Tok√©mon! My name is Toak! People call me the Tok√©mon Prof! The crypto markets are inhabited by coins and tokens! For some people, they are used as banks. Other use them for speculative investments. Myself‚Ä¶ I study Tok√©mon, Meme, and much more. Your very own Tok√©mon legend is about to unfold! A world of dreams and adventures awaits! Let's go!

## What is Tok√©mon (TM)?

Tok√©mon (TM) is an Ethereum ERC-20 Standard Compliant Token. It is the first ever Meme token, the first ever Parody Token and the first ever Meme and Parody Token. There are probably other things it is the first at too. There have been Meme coins done in the past, but never a Meme token based on the Ethereum blockchain. Tok√©mon's distribution system is also a key feature that generates value through it's own variation of mining, while creating scarcity to control the supply and demand. There is no relationship between the Pok√©mon franchise and Tok√©mon. We abide by all parody and copyright laws.

## What features / advantages does Tok√©mon have?

-  Being an ERC-20 Standard Compliant Ethereum Token, Tok√©mon benefits from pre-built secure Ethereum wallet software / apps that are already in common use. No need to reinvent the wheel. From wallets (Mist, MyEtherWallet, ethereum paper wallets) to decentralized Ethereum exchanges, etc.
- Being a meme / parody token, the core activities of Tok√©mon users revolves around memeing online, which in turn increases it's value through the spreading of interest in the token. 
- Tok√©mon uses a unique MINING and DISTRIBUTION system and works hand in hand with it's core meme / parody token concept. The only way to get Tok√©mon is through providing exposure (which is the version of mining Tok√©mon  implements), and the users who do it the most get the most tokens in return. Essentially a merit based system.
- The supply and demand is controlled in a way that assures scarcity, so as to increase the demand and overall value of Tok√©mon.

## What is the Tok√©mon distribution system? And how does it work?

The Tokemon Distribution System is the model used to distribute tokens to users based off of merit. Users who help grow the coin through Tokemons unique form of mining get Tokemon in exchange. There will not be an ICO. Here are some details so as to understand the distribution system:
- Total Maximum Supply: 151 000 000 (151 million Tokemon)
- When the token is launched, everyone starts off with 0 Tokemon, and then the process of mining defines to whom the tokens are distributed to.
- The mining process is done through users giving Tokemon exposure, whether it be through memeing on reddit, making youtube videos, or inviting users directly to discord. The process needs to be measureable, and only activities included in the #üìômining section in the Tokemon [discord channel](https://discord.gg/xT25Rsf) give Tokemon.
- 5% of Tokemon go to the Tokemon team. They are given whenever tokens are being distributed to other miners. For instance, if 95000 tokemon are given at the end of the week to miners, 5000 are given to the Tokemon team, making a total of 100 000.
- The amount of Tokemon distributed per week varies so as to be able to adjust the fine line between rewards for exposure and keeping the scarcity of the token so as to keep supply low and demand high. 
- The distribution process happens in two stages: 1) before launch; 2) after launch. Before the Launch of Tokemon, specific goals will need to be meet. Once the launch takes place, Tokemon will continue to reward participants for exposure.

## What is Tok√©mon's variation of mining?

TL;DR: Making YouTube videos, inviting users to the discord, memes on reddit, and more.
In a nutshell, actions that grow the community base of Tok√©mon are rewarded with Tokens. It's important that each action is measurable. The Mining Chart keeps an updated list of activities and the value of tokens they produce. Each action produces a certain amount of points, and there is a conversation rate of points to Tokens. Please check out the [discord channel](https://discord.gg/xT25Rsf) for the specific details.
